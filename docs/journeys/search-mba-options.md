# Search MBA Options

This journey explains how to search for courses and colleges on the home page. Follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to Home Page**  
   - When the app loads, you land on the home page. You see a straightforward, minimalistic interface with a search bar, a dropdown to choose an MBA specialization, and a "Search" button.

2. **Enter Search Criteria**  
   - Enter keywords for course or college names in the text input.  
   - Pick an MBA specialization (e.g., Finance, Marketing, HR) from the dropdown.

3. **Click the Search Button**  
   - Once your search criteria are set, click the "Search" button.  
   - The button is disabled while loading to avoid multiple submissions.

4. **View Search Results**  
   - If results are found (placeholder data for this demo), theyâ€™re displayed beneath the search area in a responsive grid or list.  
   - Each result card might show a college name, course offered, and a short description.

5. **Refine Searches or Repeat**  
   - You can modify keywords or change the MBA specialization in the dropdown.  
   - Click "Search" again to refresh results.
